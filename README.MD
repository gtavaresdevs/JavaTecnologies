# 🚀 JavaTecnologies — Personal Java Learning Projects

Welcome to my personal Java practice repository!  
This space showcases my journey in mastering Java programming through practical projects, challenges, and topic-specific exercises. Each folder here represents a hands-on implementation of a key Java concept — from the basics to more advanced topics like OOP, Generics, and Collections.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is a **self-driven initiative** to solidify my Java knowledge and coding skills.  
The work here reflects:

- Consistent hands-on practice
- Application of theoretical concepts
- Personal commitment to continuous learning
- Code written and organized manually, without automated generators

---

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools

- **Java (8+)**
- **IntelliJ IDEA** as primary IDE
- **Git** for version control
- Basic familiarity with **OOP**, **Collections**, **Enums**, and **Exception handling**

## 📈 Purpose

> This repository was created as part of my **transition into backend development**.  
> My aim is to demonstrate not just technical knowledge, but also **initiative, organization, and ability to learn independently**.

I'm using this repo to:

- Document my progression
- Experiment with new concepts
- Refactor and revisit earlier exercises as my skills evolve

---

## 📄 How to Explore

You can browse each folder individually — each contains Java `.java` files grouped by topic.  
Most challenges are console-based and can be run directly from the IDE.

## ✅ Next Steps

- Add JUnit tests to select exercises
- Document solutions with JavaDoc
- Convert some projects into small APIs using Spring Boot (WIP)
